    <h3>Living Well With Type 1</h3>
    <p>
      Type 1 Diabetes is a chronic condition in which the pancreas produces little or no insulin.
      Managing it well means checking your blood sugar levels regularly, maintaining a healthy diet,
      and staying active. Remember, you're not alone—many people live vibrant, full lives with Type 1!
    </p>
    <p>
      Support systems, like Nurse Betty, can help remind you to check levels, understand trends, and even
      provide emotional encouragement. Be kind to yourself—you are doing something remarkable each day. 💙
