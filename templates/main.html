  <h2>💙 A Letter From Mom – Why This Site Exists</h2>
  <p>
    My sweet, caring, funny son was in his late thirties and embarking on a new future,<br>
    studying hard at UC Berkeley, when out of nowhere he found himself in the worst nightmare —<br>
    plus two shades darker.<br><br>

    <strong>Type 1 Diabetes.</strong><br><br>

    The medical world basically hands you medicine, a few pamphlets,<br>
    and sends you home to live a life you have no idea what's in store for you.<br><br>

    You bounce around, doing your best, taking your shot twice a day,<br>
    changing your diet, thinking you're going to be somewhat okay.<br><br>

    Then one day you wake up in a hospital, looking at people you don't know,<br>
    who are telling you that you have been in a coma for the last three days —<br>
    and you are <em>very</em> lucky to be alive.<br><br>

    As it turns out, a headache and throwing up means you're in big trouble.<br><br>

    My hope for this site is that it will help him and others.<br>
    Sharing your experiences. Learning how to live your best life.<br><br>

    Sadly, this is not going to be easy.<br>
    But as this site grows, we will have an open chat to share experiences.<br><br>

    <strong>Love,<br>
    Mom</strong>
